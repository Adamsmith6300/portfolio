          My passion for software development began while I was building a small personal project that quickly became more complex.
          It led me to create an automatic humidity regulating system with sensors and an ultrasonic transducer.
          While tinkering on this I started work as an account representative at Sage Software.
          Speaking with clients about their software and seeing new software releases made me even more interested in technology and software development.
          I soon decided to leave Sage to study programming full time. However, between university being so expensive and Vancouver being so expensive,
          I decided to take a different approach to my education and moved to a cheaper country with the savings I had from Sage. I travelled on a tight budget and
          learned everything I know about programming online and abroad.

         I began by studying the basics of HTML and CSS and then decided I wanted to focus on JavaScript.
       </p>
       <p>
         I took an online bootcamp and studied from a multitude of resources online. I learnt about many frameworks, libraries and JavaScript technologies.
       </p>
       <p>
         In the eight months I was gone I gained experience with jQuery, Nodejs, MongoDB, Expressjs and AngularJS. I learnt about various packages and libraries such as Mongoose, Ejs, Paperjs, Howlerjs, Bootstrap, Semantic UI and of course Vanillajs!
