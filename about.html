        <p>My passion for software development began while I was building a small personal project that quickly became more complex.
         It led me to create an automatic humidity regulating system with sensors and an ultrasonic transducer.
         While tinkering on this I started work as an account representative at Sage Software.
         Speaking with clients about their software and seeing new software releases made me even more interested in technology and software development.
         I soon decided to leave Sage to study programming full time. However, between myself not seeing the value in university and Vancouver being so expensive,
         I decided to take adifferent approach to my education and moved to a cheaper country with the savings I had from Sage. I travelled on a tight budget and
         learned everything I know about programming online and abroad.
       </p>
       <p>I began by studying the basics of HTML and CSS and then decided I wanted to focus on Javascript.
       </p>
       <p>I took an online bootcamp and studied from a multitude of resources online. I learnt about many frameworks, libraries and Javascript technologies
       </p>
       <p>In the eight months I was gone I gained experience with jQuery, Nodejs, MongoDB, Expressjs and Angular1.x.
         I learnt about various packages and libraries such as Mongoose, Ejs, Paperjs, Howlerjs, Bootstrap, Semantic UI and of course Vanillajs!
